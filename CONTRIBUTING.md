## Your First Contribution

Unsure of where to start contributing to Sphinx RTD Dark Mode? A good place to start would be working on a simple issue that or feature that nobody is
assigned to yet. Issues in the [Good for Contributors colum](https://github.com/MrDogeBro/sphinx_rtd_dark_mode/projects/1#column-14516381) would be a
good place to look. If you are new to contributing, it would be good to take a look at something like [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on
GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) for some guidance.

## Getting Started

If you would like to contribute, please follow the instructions below.

1. Open and issue about it and let us know what you want changed and that you are intending on doing it.
1. Create your own fork of the repository.
1. Make all your changes in your fork. Please be sure to make sure your code meets our expectations.
1. Submit a pull request with information on your changes and have it linked to your fork.

## Reporting a Bug

To report a bug, please create a issue. When creating a issue, please try and make sure that you are very detailed in your issue and you provide all
of the necessary information. Failing to do so will result in the whole process taking much longer and potentially having your issue discarded.

## Suggesting a Feature or Enhancement

To suggest a feature or enhancement, please open an issue. If the issue needs to be discussed or is an idea you had that you are unsure of, please
open a discusion in the discussions tab. Make sure to be very clear with your suggestion so that others can understand what your idea is. Please provide
any and all relevant information to make the whole process much smoother.

## Code Review Process

I try to look at pull requests at least every week or two. When I review your pull request, I will leave any changes or feedback on the pull request.
Once the pull request meets the requirements and I am happy with the change, it will be merged into the code base. After feedback has been given a
response is expected within two weeks. If it has been more than two weeks without any activity from the pull request author, the pull request may be closed.
